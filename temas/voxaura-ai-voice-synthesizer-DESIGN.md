## Composition
Use the attached HTML reference as the source of truth. Preserve the visible hierarchy, first-screen composition, section rhythm, density, and interaction tone before adapting copy or content.
Key visible headings include: Converse Fluidly. Beyond Barriers. Infinite Scale.; Dynamic Speech; Voice Cloning; Enterprise-Ready.
## Colors
Anchor the palette in primary #4F46E5, secondary #030712, accent #06B6D4, background #030712, surface #18181B, text-primary #FFFFFF. Keep background, surface, text, and border roles distinct so generated layouts retain the same contrast pattern as the source.
## Typography
Use Geist for display moments and Geist for body copy unless the HTML clearly demands a compatible fallback. Labels and technical metadata should use JetBrains Mono or an equivalent mono face.
## Layout
Keep spacing deliberate and stable. Favor the same grid direction, max-width behavior, card density, and responsive stacking seen in the HTML. Do not replace distinctive source structures with generic SaaS sections.
## Components
Cards, buttons, badges, navigation, and repeated blocks should preserve the source geometry, border treatment, and hover feel.
## Motion
Preserve existing motion cues such as masked reveals, staggered entrance, hover lift, scroll-triggered transitions, and ambient movement. Keep easing smooth and restrained.
## WebGL & Effects

If the source includes canvas, WebGL, Three.js, gradients, particles, or atmospheric effects, rebuild them as supporting layers behind the content. Keep effects performant, responsive, and secondary to the interface.

## Guardrails
- Do not flatten the source into a generic card grid.
- Do not swap the color mode unless the source clearly supports it.
- Preserve the first viewport signal, focal object, and visual density.
- Keep buttons, cards, and badges aligned to the same radius and border language.
