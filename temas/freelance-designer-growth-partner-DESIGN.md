## Overview
The design aesthetic is high-contrast and authoritative, built upon a "Neon on Noir" core. The mood is premium and industrial, characterized by a vibrant neon-yellow accent against a deep, matte-black background. Composition relies on extreme vertical scale and negative space, anchored by a full-bleed, nested-frame structure that creates a "monitor-within-a-monitor" focus.

## Colors
- Primary Accent: #ccff00 (Neon Yellow/Lime) – used for hero typography, navigation, and core identity markers.
- Surfaces: #111111 (Matte Black) – used as the primary background for content containers.
- Secondary/Interactive: #7b61ff (Deep Purple) – reserved for primary action buttons (CTAs).
- Neutral/Atmospheric: White (Typography/UI icons) and custom gradients (black to transparent) for vignetting and text legibility.

## Typography
- Display: A massive, fluid headline utilizing `clamp(3rem, 10vw, 9rem)` with a tight line-height of 0.85 and negative letter-spacing (-0.04em). Applied in uppercase for impact.
- Body: A clean, system-stack sans-serif for optimal readability at smaller scales, utilizing generous line-height for contrast.
- Label: Uppercase, tracking-widest style (tracking-widest) used for metadata, nav links, and UI identifiers to maintain a technical, deliberate aesthetic.

## Layout
- Frame: The viewport acts as a secondary border, with padding (p-3 to p-8) defining a structural "gutter" that separates content from the edge.
- Container: A central flex-column architecture utilizes `flex-grow` to ensure content spans the full available height. 
- Rhythm: Spacing is non-linear; the top of the container uses heavy vertical padding (12-24 units) to force the headline to the center-top, while the base employs auto-margins to anchor footer content to the bottom edge.

## Elevation & Depth
- Surface Recipe: The main container uses a custom "premium-surface" border—a 1px gradient (145deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.1) to black/0.5) applied via `mask-composite: exclude` to achieve a glass-like perimeter.
- Shadows: A high-intensity `shadow-2xl` is applied to the main wrapper to lift it from the background.
- Overlays: Moody photography is layered using a mix-blend-luminosity and a layered gradient vignette (gradient-to-r and gradient-to-t) to ensure text remains legible without sacrificing dark-mode intensity.

## Shapes
- Radius Hierarchy: Rounded-2xl to rounded-[2rem] is used for the primary container to soften the industrial black box.
- Geometry: Iconography and UI elements (buttons/chips) follow a strict pill-shape (full-radius).
- Identity: The logo mark utilizes a 2x2 grid system with 1px/2px corner radii, maintaining a pixel-perfect, modular design language.

## Components
- Hero: Staggered, overflow-hidden word segments that reveal from bottom-up.
- CTA: Fully rounded pills with hover-state transitions (300ms) to alternate colors for immediate feedback.
- Nav: Minimalist link-list with uppercase text; hover effects toggle from primary yellow to white to indicate active interaction.
- Metadata: Small, tight grid-based graphic markers used to identify the "author/partner" identity.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do prioritize massive, tight-leading headlines to maintain the editorial, "poster" style.
- Do keep the background imagery at low opacity (approx. 60%) with a luminosty blend mode to ensure the neon-yellow text remains the hero.
- Don't drift from the primary color palette; only utilize purple for CTA components to avoid muddying the neon-yellow identity.
- Don't use standard drop shadows; leverage the 1px gradient mask method for a premium, edge-lit aesthetic.

## Motion
- Entrance: Hero text utilizes a vertical mask-reveal (`y: 100%` to `0%`) with `power4.out` easing, staggered by 0.1s.
- Sequence: Content elements at the base of the design (location, secondary links) employ a fade-in/slide-up reveal with a `power3.out` curve.
- Ambient: All hero imagery must include a long-duration (10s) slow-zoom effect (`scale 1.05` to `1.0`) to provide a subtle "living" quality without causing distraction.
