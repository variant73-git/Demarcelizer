## Overview
System Metrics UI Showcase Section is designed for demonstrating an app-style product interface. Key features include dashboard-like information hierarchy and app-style visual structure. Built with custom CSS, it is suitable for product showcases and interface-driven hero presentations. It includes animated visual trea

Monitor cluster performance with this sleek, dark-themed system metrics dashboard featuring dynamic canvas-based data visualizations.
## Composition
Use the attached HTML reference as the source of truth. Preserve the visible hierarchy, first-screen composition, section rhythm, density, and interaction tone before adapting copy or content.
Key visible headings include: System Metrics; Analysis.
## Colors
Anchor the palette in primary #F97316, secondary #FFFFFF, accent #EAB308, background #FFFFFF, surface #525252, text-primary #111827. Keep background, surface, text, and border roles distinct so generated layouts retain the same contrast pattern as the source.
## Typography
Use Inter for display moments and Inter for body copy unless the HTML clearly demands a compatible fallback. Labels and technical metadata should use JetBrains Mono or an equivalent mono face.
## Layout
Keep spacing deliberate and stable. Favor the same grid direction, max-width behavior, card density, and responsive stacking seen in the HTML. Do not replace distinctive source structures with generic SaaS sections.
## Components
Dashboard, chart, and data panels should preserve their compact operational hierarchy, nested surfaces, and metric emphasis.
## Motion
Preserve existing motion cues such as masked reveals, staggered entrance, hover lift, scroll-triggered transitions, and ambient movement. Keep easing smooth and restrained.
## WebGL & Effects

If the source includes canvas, WebGL, Three.js, gradients, particles, or atmospheric effects, rebuild them as supporting layers behind the content. Keep effects performant, responsive, and secondary to the interface.

## Guardrails
- Do not flatten the source into a generic card grid.
- Do not swap the color mode unless the source clearly supports it.
- Preserve the first viewport signal, focal object, and visual density.
- Keep buttons, cards, and badges aligned to the same radius and border language.
